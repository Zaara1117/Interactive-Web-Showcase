## 🌐 4. API Data Fetching

Fetch and display real-time data from public APIs with a click:

- 🌤️ **Weather Data** – Shows current weather from an open API.
- 😂 **Random Joke** – Fetches a random joke instantly.
- 👤 **Random User** – Displays a randomly generated user profile.
- 🗑️ **Clear Data** – Reset the display area.

> **Note**: All API requests are handled asynchronously with `fetch()`.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, media queries, and transitions  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation, events, fetch API
